# physioHMD
The  PhysioHMD platform introduces a software and hardware modular interface built for collecting affect and physiological data from users wearing a head-mounted display. The platform enables researchers and developers to aggregate and interpret signals in real-time and use them to develop novel, personalized interactions, as well as evaluate virtual experiences. Our design offers seamless integration with standard HMDs, requiring minimal setup effort for developers and those with less experience using game engines. The PhysioHMD platform is a flexible architecture that offers an interface that is not only easy to extend but also complemented by a suite of tools for testing and analysis. We hope that PhysioHMD can become a universal, publicly available testbed for VR and AR researchers.
